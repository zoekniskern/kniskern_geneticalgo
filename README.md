exploring genetic algorithms

My goal for this project was to explore how a genetic algorithm can be applied to generative abstract art. Using three basic layouts and color combinations from a set color palette, the user is able to choose which images are most appealing, and a new generation is created from those. Both a crossover and a mutuation step are included in the reproductive step. 

Although multiple clicks register higher fitness values, not much was done with this information. There is also an inconsistent error where the default state of the art type switch statement is triggered. To make this less noticeable, a plain rectangle within the color scheme is drawn. The hitbox for selecting the preferred rectangles is slightly off, so the user needs to click in the center of the rectangles for it to register.

Although there are features I would be interested in perfecting or building out, overall I am pleased with the results of this project. The GA works as expected and the result is visually pleasant.
